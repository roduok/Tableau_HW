	* Most of the bottom 10 stations for ending a journey are across a river in NJ. There is probably an inconveince of riding your bike alongside a river that goes through a tunnel.I
		I can also imagine that the trail might be rougher. All of these stations only had one ride ended there
		it could also be that these stations no longer exist.

	* Very - a few bikes are utilized a lot, while the others are only used a handful of times.


**Additionally, city officials would like to see the following visualizations:**

* A static map that plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey with zip code data overlaid on top.
	* See the dashboard.

* A dynamic map that shows how each station's popularity changes over time (by month and year) -- with commentary pointing to any interesting events that may be behind these phenomena.

**Lastly, as a chronic over-achiever, you must also:**

* Find at least two unexpected phenomena in the data and provide a visualization and analysis to document their presence. 
	* It seems like most bikes are repaired once they reach 7,000 miles as there were no bike id's with usage over 7k.
	* People bike to NJ which is really far and strange due to various ways of transportation in NY.
