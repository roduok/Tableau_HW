**Additionally, city officials would like to see the following visualizations:**

* A static map that plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey with zip code data overlaid on top.
	* See the dashboard.

* A dynamic map that shows how each station's popularity changes over time (by month and year) -- with commentary pointing to any interesting events that may be behind these phenomena.

**Lastly, as a chronic over-achiever, you must also:**

* Find at least two unexpected phenomena in the data and provide a visualization and analysis to document their presence. 
	* One bike has been ridden over 10,000 miles. The next closest bike was ridden around 5,000 miles. 
	* People bike to NJ. NJ isn't even a real state.
